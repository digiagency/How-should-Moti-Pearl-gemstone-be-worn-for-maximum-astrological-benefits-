# How-should-Moti-Pearl-gemstone-be-worn-for-maximum-astrological-benefits-

To gain the full astrological benefits of Moti or Pearl gemstone, it should be worn with proper rituals and precautions. Pearls are usually worn in silver rings, as silver enhances the Moonâ€™s calming energy. The best finger to wear a Pearl ring is the little finger of the right hand. According to astrology, the ideal day to wear Moti is Monday, as it is ruled by the Moon. The gemstone should be purified before wearing. This is usually done by dipping it in raw milk, Gangajal, or holy water while chanting the Moon mantra. The weight of the Pearl also matters; generally, it is recommended to wear at least 4 to 6 carats of a natural and genuine Pearl. Synthetic or cultured pearls may not give the same astrological effects. The stone should always touch the skin for its energy to transfer. When worn correctly, Moti helps in stabilizing emotions, enhancing creativity, and improving overall health. Following these steps ensures that the gemstone provides its full positive influence.
